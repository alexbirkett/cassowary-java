As of February 2015 it's unclear if the ebolwidt port of cassowary is being maintained. 
The pybee port has been active more recently https://github.com/pybee/cassowary-java


This is a modified version of the port of the Cassowary Constraint Solving Toolkit version 0.60 to Java.

Information about the original version of Cassowary can be found at: http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary
